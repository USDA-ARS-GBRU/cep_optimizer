Using gurobipy for python, I would like to perform an optimization to place of Schools S into N groups to maximize the enrollment weighted reimbursement rate R.
Here is the problem.
I have a set of schools, S. where each school is denoted as Si...Sn.
Each school has enrollment k
Each school has a proportion of the enrollment designated ISP
Group rules: Schools can be group in to N groups where each school is in exactly 1 group, all schools must be in a group. There can be between 1 group and Sn groups. Each group must have 1 or more schools.
For each group of schools the reimbursement can be calculated from the enrollment weighted average ISP of all schools in the group. this function where the weighed ISP is I:

def compute_reimbursement(I):
    # Heaviside function implementation
    H = 1 if I > 0.625 else 0
    
    # Continuous formula
    R = 4.5 * H + (4.5 * (I * 1.6) + 0.5 * (1 - I)) * (1 - H)
    return R

Objective 1: assign schools to groups to maximize the enrollment weighted reimbursement R for all groups (itself weighted by enrollment)

Return a list of schools groups and the weighted R for each group and the weighted R for all schools.

Data will be input as a pandas dataframe this form 

STATE	LEA_NAME	SCHOOL	ISP	ISP_CATEGORY	PARTICIPATION_IN_CEP_(Y OR BLANK)	ENROLLMENT
Alaska	ANCHORAGE SCHOOLS	ABBOTT LOOP ELEMENTARY	40.6%	40%-50%	N	286

For each group of schools a per meal per_meal_cep_reimbursement can be calculated as

# Prompt 3 with simplified linear objective

Please create a new script using gurobipy for python, I would like to perform an optimization to place of Schools S into N groups to maximize the enrollment weighted reimbursement rate R.
Here is the problem.
I have a set of schools, S. where each school is denoted as Si...Sn.
Each school has enrollment k
Each school has a proportion of the enrollment designated ISP
the variable ISP_count = round(ISP * enrollment) 
Group rules: 
    - 1. Schools can be grouped in to N groups
    - Each school is in exactly 1 group
    - 2. all schools must be in a group.
    - There can be between 1 group and Sn groups, where Sn is the total number of schools
    - Each group must have 1 or more schools
    
There is one objective:


maximize the sum of enrollment from groups where group ISP is >= 0.25


    Data will be input as a pandas dataframe this form 

STATE	LEA_NAME	SCHOOL	ISP	ISP_CATEGORY	PARTICIPATION_IN_CEP_(Y OR BLANK)	ENROLLMENT
Alaska	ANCHORAGE SCHOOLS	ABBOTT LOOP ELEMENTARY	40.6%	40%-50%	N	286
Alaska	ANCHORAGE SCHOOLS	AIRPORT HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY	62.2%	60% and higher	Y	274

Alaska	ANCHORAGE SCHOOLS	BARTLETT HIGH SCHOOL	47.9%	40%-50%	Y	1268

actual data will be read in from a csv file example.csv

after fitting the model please provide a comparison of  the sum of enrollement meeting the criteria
For comparison provide the value when 1. all schools are in one group and 2. when each school is in its own group.

Using gurobipy for python, I would like to perform an optimization to place of Schools S into N groups to maximize the enrollment weighted reimbursement rate R.
Here is the problem.
I have a set of schools, S. where each school is denoted as Si...Sn.
Each school has enrollment k
Each school has a proportion of the enrollment designated ISP
the variable ISP_count = round(ISP * enrollment)
The number of groups N is given by the user
Group rules: 
    - Each school is in exactly 1 group


For each group of schools  the grout ISP (I) canc be calculates as:

I = sum(IST_count)/ sum(enrollment)

The group reimbusement  can be calulated as 

def per_meal_cep_reimbursement(ISP_Count: list, free_rate=4.5, paid_rate=0.5):
    """
    Compute  the cep reimbursement rate based on enrollment weighted ISP of all schools.
    """

        return (free_rate * I * 1.6) + paid_rate * (1 - I)
    else:
        return 0

    The objective is to assign each school to a group in a way that maximizes the sum of the enrollment * per_meal_cep_reimbursement for all groups
